== TestBalloon Development

=== Overview

TestBalloon comprises these components (appearing as Gradle subprojects):

. *framework-core*: The Kotlin Multiplatform library containing all core framework functions.
. *compiler-plugin*: A Kotlin compiler plugin generating code to discover all top-level test suites and run them as directed by Kotlin's standard Gradle test tasks. Think of it as providing the `main()` function for tests.
. *gradle-plugin*: A Gradle plugin enabling the TestBalloon Kotlin compiler plugin, configurable in Gradle build scripts via the `testBalloon` extension. The Gradle plugin also sets up JUnit Platform, which is required to run tests on the JVM.
. *framework-abstractions*: Basic abstractions defining what a hierarchical test structure looks like, so that the core library, the compiler plugin, and an IDE plugin share a common concept of that test structure.

In addition to the above, there are *integrations-**, providing TestBalloon interoperability with other test-related libraries.

=== Tasks

==== Testing the Compiler Plugin

1. Run the compiler plugin in-process with Gradle.
+
--
To run the Gradle tasks `clean compileTestKotlinJvm` for the xref:../examples/framework-core[examples/framework-core] project:

* `gradlew -Dorg.gradle.debug=true -Pkotlin.compiler.execution.strategy=in-process :examples:core:clean :examples:core:compileTestKotlinJvm`
--

2. Attach the JVM debugger to port 5005. In IntelliJ IDEA, use the command _Run â€“ Attach to Process_.
