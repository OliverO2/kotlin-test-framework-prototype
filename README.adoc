== A Kotlin Multiplatform Test Framework Prototype

This prototype aims to explore a flexible, concise and maintainable Kotlin Multiplatform test framework architecture.

The goal: Testing Kotlin like Kotlin â€“ concise, native everywhere, productive, fun. Will this help us get there?

=== Features

* A *test hierarchy* represented by *nestable ``TestElement``s*.
** ``Test``s are test elements containing actual test logic with assertions, they cannot have child elements.
** ``TestSuite``s are test elements grouping child elements, they cannot contain test logic.
** ``TestCompartments``s are test elements grouping top-level test suites, with each compartment running in isolation.
** A ``TestSession`` is the root of the test hierarchy for an individual test run.
* *Tests and suites* can be *created dynamically* via plain Kotlin.
* Tests are fully *coroutine-aware*, coroutine contexts mirror the suites/tests hierarchy.
* Suites support *lazily initialized test fixtures* with ``AutoCloseable``support. Fixture *initialization and tear-down* (auto-close) functions *can suspend*.
* Suites support a *suspending ``aroundAll``* action.
* *Suite nesting* and *suspending suite-level actions* are *fully supported on JavaScript* engines, using the Kotlin/JS test infra.
* A global *TestSession* provides configuration defaults. A customized variant can be declared.
* *Compartments* isolate suites with different *configuration and concurrency requirements*.
* Test elements can be configured via an extensible set of `TestConfig` elements, which can be combined by chaining.
* The entire framework is platform independent with almost zero redundancy.
* The architecture favors simplicity and aims to avoid implicit constructs and indirection.

link:samples/prototype-scenarios/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/example/Tests.kt[This example] shows how it looks like.

=== Background

I have been working for several years on (non-mobile) frontend and backend stuff, using the two most popular Kotlin test frameworks, https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/[kotlin-test] and https://kotest.io/[Kotest]. I am involved in maintaining Kotest. I have also researched other test framework approaches like https://www.spekframework.org/[Spek], https://github.com/failgood/failgood[failgood] and https://opensavvy.gitlab.io/groundwork/prepared/docs/index.html[OpenSavvy Prepared].

What I've been missing so far is the combination of

* an expressive and powerful API with a small API surface,
* uniform multiplatform functionality (everything works everywhere in the same way),
* a lean (maintainable) implementation,
* a complete feature set for common usage scenarios,
* composability, allowing users to extend the framework easily for special needs,
* a developer experience with as little surprise (including quirks, bugs) as possible.

=== Evolution

The results of my research and experimentation with this prototype are reflected in these xref:documentation/Design Considerations.adoc[Design Considerations]. What matters to me is not maximizing some feature set (au contraire!), but having a well-thought-out, concise and easy-to-understand API, that lets us do testing as productively as possible.

Of course, I've also been researching how to integrate with build tooling, IntelliJ IDEA and Kotlin's existing test infrastructure. Some of my findings are laid out in xref:documentation/Kotlin IDE and Build Tool Interoperability.adoc[Kotlin IDE and Build Tool Interoperability].

=== Sample Applications

==== Running all tests

* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests allTests`

'''

* `./gradlew -p samples/using-kotlin-test --quiet cleanAllTests allTests`
* `./gradlew -p samples/using-prototype --quiet cleanAllTests allTests`

==== Running tests for individual targets

* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests jvmTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests jsNodeTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests jsBrowserTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests wasmJsNodeTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests wasmJsBrowserTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests wasmWasiNodeTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests linuxX64Test`

'''

* `./gradlew -p samples/using-kotlin-test --quiet cleanAllTests jvmTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/using-prototype --quiet cleanAllTests clean jvmTest`
* `./gradlew -p samples/using-prototype --quiet cleanAllTests clean jsNodeTest`

==== Running tests for compiler plugin debugging

1. `./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios -Dorg.gradle.debug=true -Pkotlin.compiler.execution.strategy=in-process clean compileTestKotlinJvm`
2. Attach the debugger to port 5005.

=== Limitations

==== Test reporting

* The IDE does not report more than one level of suite nesting for tests using the Kotlin/JS infra (JS/Browser, JS/Node, Wasm/JS/Browser). While all suites appear, they are not properly nested, because the names of intermediate levels are cut out on their way from the test framework to the IDE.
* Gradle XML test reports are incomplete: Wasm/JS/Node, Wasm/WASI and Native are missing.

==== IntelliJ IDEA integration

An IntelliJ IDEA plugin supports running individual tests or suites from source code via gutter icons.

In IntelliJ IDEA, it is currently not possible to

* run tests from the test run window,
* rerun failed tests from the test run window,
* run failed tests from the inspections window.

==== Gradle Test Filtering

Depending on the target, selection supports command line arguments, environment variables, or system properties. Selection patterns support the wildcard `*`.

NOTE: Environment variables and system properties must be relayed to the test task (see xref:samples/prototype-scenarios/build.gradle.kts[samples/prototype-scenarios/build.gradle.kts]).

Selecting tests via Gradle invocations is possible for targets checkmarked below.

* [x] `++./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests jvmTest -DTEST_INCLUDE=com.example.TestSuite1.test1++`
+
--
NOTE: The JVM test task does not tolerate a `--tests` option without a wildcard in the fully qualified "class" name. Omitting the wildcard leads to "No tests found for given includes: [com.example.TestSuite1.test1](--tests filter)".
--
* [x] `++./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests jsNodeTest --tests com.example.TestSuite1.test1++`
+
--
NOTE: The `jsNodeTest` supports post-run selection only: It runs all tests, then displays the selected ones in the IDE's test results hierarchy window.
--
* [x] `++./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests jsBrowserTest --tests com.example.TestSuite1.test1++`
* [x] `++./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests wasmJsNodeTest --tests com.example.TestSuite1.test1++`
* [ ] `++./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests wasmJsBrowserTest --tests com.example.TestSuite1.test1++`
* [ ] `++./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests wasmWasiNodeTest --tests com.example.TestSuite1.test1++`
* [x] `++./gradlew -p samples/prototype-scenarios --quiet cleanAllTests linuxX64Test++`
+
--
in an IDE run configuration with an environment variable setting:

* `++TEST_INCLUDE=com.example.TestSuite1.test1++`
--

=== TODO

* [x] Provide integration for Kotest assertions.
* [ ] Add a "fail fast" configuration option, stopping a test (suite/compartment/session) execution after a configurable number of test failures.
** Make it universal by providing a global (suite/test/both) wrapper?
