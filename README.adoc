== A Kotlin Multiplatform Test Framework Prototype

This prototype aims to explore a flexible, concise and maintainable Kotlin Multiplatform test framework architecture.

The goal: Testing Kotlin like Kotlin â€“ concise, native everywhere, productive, fun. Will this help us get there?

=== Features

* A *test hierarchy* represented by *nestable ``TestElement``s*.
** ``Test``s are test elements containing actual test logic with assertions, they cannot have child elements.
** ``TestSuite``s are test elements grouping child elements, they cannot contain test logic.
** A ``TestSession`` is the root of the test hierarchy for an individual test run.
* *Tests and suites* can be *created dynamically* via plain Kotlin.
* Tests are fully *coroutine-aware*, coroutine contexts mirror the suites/tests hierarchy.
* Suites support *lazily initialized test fixtures* with ``AutoCloseable``support. Fixture *initialization and tear-down* (auto-close) functions *can suspend*.
* Suites support a *suspending ``aroundAll``* action.
* *Suite nesting* and *suspending suite-level actions* are *fully supported on JavaScript* engines, using the Kotlin/JS test infra.
* A global *TestSession* provides configuration defaults. A customized variant can be declared.
* *Compartments* isolate suites with different *concurrency requirements*.
* The entire framework is platform independent with almost zero redundancy.
* The architecture favors simplicity and aims to avoid implicit constructs and indirection.

=== Background

I have been working for several years on (non-mobile) frontend and backend stuff, using the two most popular Kotlin test frameworks, https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/[kotlin-test] and https://kotest.io/[Kotest]. I am involved in maintaining Kotest. I have also researched other test framework approaches like https://www.spekframework.org/[Spek], https://github.com/failgood/failgood[failgood] and https://opensavvy.gitlab.io/groundwork/prepared/docs/index.html[OpenSavvy Prepared].

What I've been missing so far is the combination of

* an expressive and powerful API with a small API surface,
* uniform multiplatform functionality (everything works everywhere in the same way),
* a lean (maintainable) implementation,
* a complete feature set for common usage scenarios,
* composability, allowing users to extend the framework easily for special needs,
* a developer experience with as little surprise (including quirks, bugs) as possible.

The results of my research and experimentation with this prototype are reflected in these xref:documentation/Design Considerations.adoc[Design Considerations]. What matters to me is not maximizing some feature set (au contraire!), but having a well-thought-out, concise and easy-to-understand API, that lets us do testing as productively as possible.

Of course, I've also been researching how to integrate with build tooling, IntelliJ IDEA and Kotlin's existing test infrastructure. Some of my findings are laid out in xref:documentation/Kotlin IDE and Build Tool Interoperability.adoc[Kotlin IDE and Build Tool Interoperability].

=== Bootstrapping A Local Build

This project builds a Gradle plugin. Its sample application depends on accessing the Gradle plugin from a repository. Initially, it will not be there. To bootstrap this project using a local repository:

[arabic]
. In ``application/build.gradle.kts``: comment out the line``alias(libs.plugins.test.framework.prototype)``.
. ``./gradlew clean publishAllPublicationsToLocalRepository``
. In ``application/build.gradle.kts``: re-enable the line``alias(libs.plugins.test.framework.prototype)``.

=== Running Tests

* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests allTests`
* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests jvmTest`
* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests jsNodeTest`
* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests jsBrowserTest`
* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests wasmJsNodeTest`
* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests wasmJsBrowserTest`
* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests wasmWasiNodeTest`
* `./gradlew -p application cleanAllTests linuxX64Test`

=== Limitations

* The IDE does not report more than one level of suite nesting for tests using the Kotlin/JS infra (JS/Browser, JS/Node, Wasm/JS/Browser). While all suites appear, they are not properly nested, because the names of intermediate levels are cut out on their way from the test framework to the IDE.
* Integration for IntelliJ IDEA is grossly incomplete:
** It supports class-level actions (run, debug, jump to source) from the test run window for JVM tests only.
** It does not support non-class suite/test actions from the test run window.
** It does not support running individual tests via editor gutters or the test run window.
** It does not support "rerun failed tests" from the test run window.
** It does not support running failed tests from the inspections window.
* Selecting tests via Gradle invocations is possible for targets checkmarked below. Depending on the target, selection supports command line arguments, environment variables, or system properties. Sometimes regular expressions are used, sometimes glob-like patterns, depending on the existing Gradle infrastructure.

NOTE: Environment variables and system properties must be relayed to the test task (see xref:application/build.gradle.kts[application/build.gradle.kts]).

** [x] `++./gradlew -p application --quiet cleanAllTests jvmTest -DTEST_INCLUDE=.*TestSuite1\.test.* -DTEST_EXCLUDE=.*test3-2++`

with IDE run configuration environment variables:

=== TODO

* Combine sequential execution and parallelism into one settings class.
** Use the test dispatcher by default.
** Use the default dispatcher if concurrent execution is chosen.
* Restrict suite-specific configuration to suites?
* Use https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/d9ddcd991bf9c6122041f0276af644be0432fa38/libraries/tools/kotlin-gradle-plugin/src/common/kotlin/org/jetbrains/kotlin/gradle/targets/native/internal/KotlinNativeStackTraceParser.kt[KotlinNativeStackTraceParser.kt] to reference source locations in Native stack traces.
* Check whether to use `@DslMarker` to avoid suite functions being available in tests.
* Add an IntelliJ plugin.
